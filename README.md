# Churn-rate-analysis
In this project, I focused on analyzing the churn rate of a Prosperity Bank Ltd (Dummy bank) using Power BI. The primary objective was to identify the factors influencing customer churn and provide actionable insights to reduce it. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization capabilities, I created an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that displayed key metrics like total active_customer, credit_type segmentation, and churn trends over time. The dashboard allowed stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior, enabling them to make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention strategies. Through this project, I successfully empowered the bank's management team with valuable information to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty while ultimately contributing to the bank's long-term success.
